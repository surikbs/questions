          you have been looking to grow and improve. you have been successful year on year. I only want to work for an \
          organization like your that has ambitious plans for the future.
        - your products and services are clearly created a very high standards.
          during my research before coming for the interview, i had a look online at the feedback that you receive from your
          customers and they all love your products and services.
          which again tells me that you do everything to a very high standards
        - i only want to work for an organization that is always looking to improve and push the boundaries of innovation
          that's one of the reason why i want to work because i am somebody who want to continually improve, grow and develop
