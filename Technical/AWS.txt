* Types of EBS storage ? 
 General Purpose SSD ( gp2 ), 
 Provisioned IOPS SSD ( io1 ), 
 Throughput Optimized HDD ( st1 ),

 Magnetic ( standard , a previous-generation type).
 
* How to backup a running instance ? 
* How to secure s3 bucket ?
* What are the security available for users to access S3 ?
Amazon S3 offers access policy options broadly categorized as resource-based policies and user policies. Access policies you attach to your resources (buckets and objects) are referred 
to as resource-based policies. For example, bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) are resource-based policies. You can also attach access policies to users in your account.
 These are called user policies. You may choose to use resource-based policies, user policies, or some combination of these to manage permissions to your Amazon S3 resources.
 The introductory topics provide general guidelines for managing permissions

* What are the main components of CloudFormation ?
* What is mapping in cloudformation template ? 
* How is YAML different from JSON ? 
* Different types of ELB ? 
* What is autoscaling group ?
* Which type of ELB is good for application load ?
* What is difference between application load balancer & classic load balancer ?
aws.amazon.com
The Classic Load Balancer operates on both the request and connection levels. ...
A Classic Load Balancer is recommended only for EC2 Classic instances. 
The Application Load Balancer operates at the request level only. 
If you're dealing with HTTP requests, which you are for your web application, you can use this

* What is metrics in cloudwatch ?
* Is it possible to recover your lost private key ?

Amazon EC2 doesn't keep a copy of your private key; therefore, if you lose a private key, there is no way to recover it. ...
If you lose the private key for an EBS-backed Linux instance, you can regain access to your instance

* How can you connect your EC2 Instance if you lost your key ?
* While connecting to your EC2 instances, what are the possible connection issues one might face ? 
⦁ Connection timed out

⦁ User key not recognized by the server

⦁ Host key not found, permission denied

⦁ Unprotected private key file (Company)

⦁ Server refused our key or No supported authentication method available

⦁ Error using MindTerm on Safari Browser

⦁ Error using Mac OS X RDP Client

* What is Subnet & how many subnets are there in a VPC ? 
 If you create more than one subnet in a VPC, the CIDR blocks of the subnets cannot overlap. For example, 
 if you create a VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24 , it supports 256 IP addresses. You can break this CIDR block into two subnets, each supporting 128 IP addresses.
* Why do we make subnets ?
It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC. ... 
When you create a subnet, you specify the CIDR block for the subnet, which is a subset of the VPC CIDR block.
* What is routing table ? 
* How you can connect a private subnet with a public subnet ?
* Can VPC peering possible in two different region ?
