Dockers & Containers
######################
* Whats is docker ? 
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts
it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package
* Difference between container & VMs ?
* Difference between Docker & Virtualization ?
* Difference between container and image ?
* How image builds ?
* What are image layers ?
What are the layers? Docker containers are building blocks for applications. Each container is an image with a readable/writeable layer on top of a bunch of read-only layers. 
These layers (also called intermediate images) are generated when the commands in the Dockerfile are executed during the Docker image build
* How image layers work ?
* What is overlayfs ?
OverlayFS is a modern union filesystem that is similar to AUFS, but faster and with a simpler implementation. ...
 This topic refers to the Linux kernel driver as OverlayFS and to the Docker storage driver as overlay or overlay2 .
* Where the image layes can be found in which directory ?
/var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/imagedb/metadata

* How can we check the content of each layer ?
docker history imagename

* How to check the layers stacked with image ?
* What is Union Mount & AUFS ?
* Why use Union mount system for Docker ?
* What are the 3 different directories in /var/lib/docker/aufs ?

* How a container gets an internal IP ?
* Can we check the process of a container inside as well as outside the container ?
* Can we check the container process on docker host ?
* How kernel isolates to run the container and how resources managed by the kernel ?
* What is namespace and cgroups ?
* What is docker-compose and docker-swarm ?
* How you can give different network IP to the container ?
* What are the parameters of dockerfile ?
* Is there any windows container also available ?

* How to run an image which is in tar format ?
* Command to check the process of a container ?
* How to check resource utilisation of a container ?
* How to create an image ?
* How to save changes of a container ?
* What are registries ? 
* Difference between docker commands: up, run & start ?
* Can we run more than one process in a container ?
Docker Task
#############
Part 1. Write a Docker file to create a Docker image which should have Wordpress installed
Part 2. Write a Docker file to create a Docker image for database
Now, use Docker compose to bring up the above Docker images as containers. Database container should mount the local host's “/etc/mysql” volume into it's (containers) /etc/mysql directory.
